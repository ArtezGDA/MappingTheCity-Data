####Research goal
We will be researching and visualising sister-cities starting at
Arnhem, NL, and collecting for each of its sister-cities their
respective sister-cities, creating a large index of connecting cities
in the world.

####Contents
A list of cities that through their sister-cities can all be traced back to Arnhem. 14 city connections until you get to Arnhem is the furthest away.

[All cities found](arnhem_tree_Thu-Apr-14-2016-100114-GMT0200-CESTunique.txt)

A recursive node.js code that scrapes cities and their respective sister-cities, continuing until it can only find cities it has already found. Starting at Arnhem.
